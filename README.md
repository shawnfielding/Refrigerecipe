An app for singles, couples and - mostly bachelors... 
1) You inventory what's in the fridge
2) The app takes the inventory and searches through a database or API of recipes to find a selection which require little or no purchases of additional ingredients
3)  you choose the recipe you want and it gives you a shopping list
4) you can either send the shopping list to instacart or to yourself via SMS at a future time (reminder)


Requirements:
Node/Express: done.
  GETs: recipes, needed food
  Post: fridge food
  
New package: peapod, google calendar?

Mysql database
  Structure:
  userid, password (should be the same as peadpod)
  userhas id: userid, foodid
  foodid, foodname
  userecipeid, userid(fk), recipeid(fk) (if we save recipes)
  recipeid, recipeurl, recipename (if we save recipes)
  
 Interfaces required:
 login
 view/edit fridge ingredients
 view recipes (possbily with identified missing ingredients?)
 (would we need an interface for missing ingredients if we sent them to peapod?  Maybe.)
 
 SEO note:  Shawn: look into google mobile recipe data structure and schema.org possibilities.
